# Skies-of-Industry
Skies of Industry is a Minecraft skyblock modpack with a strong focus on automation. You start with infinite drawers of wood and andesite, and you'll obtain most of your resources from them.
Recipes are heavily tweaked to encourage setting up complex production lines and automation, including custom multiblocks.

The pack is currently in relatively early development, and most of the progression is not yet implemented.
